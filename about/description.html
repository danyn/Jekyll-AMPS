    This is a build tool that uses gulp, npm, and jekyll.  As such its dependencies are spread a little wider than might be ideal. However this is only to accomodate separating all the scss into files that can be placed with their html to create components that work together and are not tied up into different ways of organizing the stylesheets.  As such the css is completely modular and only global css is not included this way (bass.css, normalize.css, and any styles that you need to reuse across pages).

    Recently the AMPS plugin for wordpress has improved greatly.  It accomplishes all of the end results of this build but in a much more graceful way.  It analyzes the DOM to only include css that will affect the page unlike this process where the programmer needs to manually include them.

    * rewritting the scss compiling process in ruby to work with githup pages as a plugin would be a cleaner solution.
